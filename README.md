**GSD-Antigravity Kit** is the official bootstrapping and management utility for the [Get Shit Done (GSD)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) protocol within the Antigravity AI framework. It serves as a high-performance **Installer** and **Skill Manager** that provision, optimizes, and maintains GSD skills in your AG environment.

## ⚡ Why GSD-Antigravity Kit?

Standard GSD is powerful, but this kit optimizes it specifically for the Antigravity ecosystem:

*   **Token Efficiency**: Refactored core engine uses 2-space indentation and modular inclusions, saving ~25KB of context space per turn.
*   **Context Control**: The `--include` flag allows sub-agents to request only specific parts of the project state (e.g., just the roadmap).
*   **Native Integration**: 100% rebranded and path-mapped to live inside the `.agent/skills/` directory, avoiding collision with global installations.

## 💎 The GSD Experience (Powered by this Kit)

Once this kit installs the GSD Skill, it enables the **GSD Cycle** in your project:

1.  **Phase 1: Plan**: Deep-probe requirements, surface hidden assumptions, and generate a serialized `.planning/PLAN.md`.
2.  **Phase 2: Execute**: Atomic, wave-based implementation where agents follow the plan without deviation.
3.  **Phase 3: Verify**: Conversational UAT to ensure the implementation matches the original intent.

### 🛠️ Advanced Tooling (Kit-Exclusives)
The kit automatically enhances the core `gsd-tools.cjs` engine with:
- **Smart Inclusion Engine**: Use `--include` flags to selectively embed context.
- **Hierarchical Artifact Discovery**: Automated lookup of phase-specific documents across nested directories.
- **Persona Profiles**: Pre-tuned AI model configurations (Quality, Balance, Budget) optimized for AG.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Installation is handled via `npx` to automatically provision your current project root:

### 1️⃣ Provision the Kit
```bash
# In your project root:
npx gsd-antigravity-kit
```

### 2️⃣ Initialize the GSD Engine
Run the converter script provided by the kit to fetch and package the GSD protocol:

**Option 1: In-AG Prompt (Recommended)**
```text
/gsd-converter
```

**Option 2: CLI**
```bash
py .agent/skills/gsd-converter/scripts/convert.py gsd
```

### 3️⃣ Manual Installation of GSD Skill (Pre-Converted)
If you prefer to add the GSD skill to your project manually without using the converter:
- This kit is periodically updated to maintain parity with the original GSD protocol (you can verify version synchronization via the [GSD Changelog](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)).
- Simply create a `.agent/skills` directory in your project root and copy the `gsd` folder from this repository into it.

This repository is structured to separate the kit's logic from the generated skill:

```text

│       └── gsd/           # The Managed GSD Skill (Generated/Modified by Kit)

## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgements

The **GSD-Antigravity Kit** stands on the shoulders of giants. We owe a debt of gratitude to the original creators who pioneered the spec-driven development movement:

### 🌟 The GSD Protocol
The core logic, philosophy, and original script engine were created by **[glittercowboy](https://github.com/glittercowboy)**. Without the original [Get Shit Done (GSD)](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done) system, this kit would have no engine to manage.

- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done)
- **Documentation**: [The GSD Handbook](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/tree/main/.claude/get-shit-done)
- **Original GSD Changelog and Version**: [Changelog](https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
